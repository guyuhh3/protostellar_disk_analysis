Protostellar disk formation simulations comparing the effects of assuming ideal vs. non-ideal 
(Ohmic resistivity, ambipolar diffusion, and the Hall effect) magnetohydrodynamics, sub-grid
protostellar jet feedback, on disk formation and evolution.

Initial conditions: 50 solar mass molecular cloud core, R = 0.3077 pc (box size = 3.077 pc),
mass resolution dm = 1e-5 Msun/particle (~5 million PartType0 gas particles).

Included models:
  - non-ideal OA: non-ideal MHD (Ohmic+ambipolar), no jet feedback.
    - forms one sink particle (996106), one disk (most massive disk out of all models).
  - non-ideal OAH: non-ideal MHD (Ohmic+ambipolar+Hall), no jet feedback.
    - forms 4 sink particles, which become two binary systems, (701553, 3182263) and
      (1873423, 1714272).
  - non-ideal OAH+jets: non-ideal MHD (ohmic+ambipolar+Hall), sub-grid protostellar jet
    feed-back (see STARFORGE methods paper if interested).
      - forms 10 sink particles, some short-lived disks at early times are quickly 
        disrupted by jet feedback; long-lived binary disk (sink particles 1984874, 
        2001958) emerges at later times.
        
Other notes:
  - PartType5 particle = sink particle = (proto)star.
  - disk hdf5 files contain list of all ParticleIDs of all gas particles belonging to
    a disk in the corresponding simulation snapshot; may be helpful if you want to 
    look at disk properties (e.g., average temperature, density, etc - see Disk class
    in protostellar_disk_analysis github repo for details).
